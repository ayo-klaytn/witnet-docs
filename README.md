# Witnet Oracle Docs

The [Witnet](https://winet.io) decentralized oracle enables smart contracts to realize their true potential by giving them access to all sorts of valuable data sets, and by attesting and delivering that information securely thanks to its strong cryptoeconomic guarantees.

Witnet can power most DeFi primitives like price feeds, stablecoins, synthetics, etc., as well as acting as a reliable source of randomness for creating uniqueness in NFTs.

The Witnet oracle is currently available on [Ethereum](smart-contracts/witnet-data-feeds/contract-addresses/ethereum-price-feeds.md), [Conflux](smart-contracts/witnet-data-feeds/contract-addresses/conflux-price-feeds.md), [Boba](smart-contracts/witnet-data-feeds/contract-addresses/boba-price-feeds.md), [Celo](smart-contracts/witnet-data-feeds/contract-addresses/celo-price-feeds.md), [KCC](smart-contracts/witnet-data-feeds/contract-addresses/kcc-price-feeds.md), [Metis](smart-contracts/witnet-data-feeds/contract-addresses/metis-price-feeds.md) and other blockchains.
