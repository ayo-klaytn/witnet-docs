# Quick Tutorials

Here you can find straight-to-the-point tutorials on how to start using the Witnet oracle and other relevant topics like operating Witnet nodes and mining Wit tokens.

### Data Feeds Tutorial

The [Data Feeds tutorial](data-feeds-tutorial.md) gives a quick overlook on what are data feeds, how the Witnet data feeds work, and how to start using them with only a few lines of Solidity.

Check out the [Data Feeds tutorial](data-feeds-tutorial.md).

### Randomness Tutorial

The [Randomness tutorial](randomness.md) introduces the concept of randomness sources, how the Witnet randomness source work, and how to start generating random numbers with only a few lines of Solidity.

Check out the [Randomness tutorial](randomness.md).

### APIs and HTTP GET/POST Tutorial

The [APIs and HTTP GET/POST tutorial](apis-and-http-get-post.md) is a quick introduction to how totally custom data requests can be built with Witnet to use any arbitrary HTTP(S) API as a data source for your smart contracts.
