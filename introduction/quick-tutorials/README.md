# Quick Tutorials

Here you can find straight-to-the-point tutorials on how to start using the Witnet oracle and other relevant topics like operating Witnet nodes and mining Wit tokens.

### Data Feeds Tutorial

The [Data Feeds tutorial](data-feeds.md) gives a quick overlook on what are data feeds, how the Witnet data feeds work, and how to start using them with only a few lines of Solidity:

{% content-ref url="data-feeds.md" %}
[data-feeds.md](data-feeds.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Randomness Tutorial

The [Randomness tutorial](randomness.md) introduces the concept of randomness sources, how the Witnet randomness source work, and how to start generating random numbers with only a few lines of Solidity:

{% content-ref url="randomness.md" %}
[randomness.md](randomness.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### APIs and HTTP GET/POST Tutorial

The [APIs and HTTP GET/POST tutorial](apis-and-http-get-post.md) is a quick introduction to how totally custom data requests can be built with Witnet to use any arbitrary HTTP(S) API as a data source for your smart contracts:

{% content-ref url="apis-and-http-get-post.md" %}
[apis-and-http-get-post.md](apis-and-http-get-post.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Mining Wit Tutorial

The [Mining Wit tutorial](mining-wit.md) teaches how to easily participate in the mining of the Wit token by running a Witnet _witnessing_ node on Docker:

{% content-ref url="mining-wit.md" %}
[mining-wit.md](mining-wit.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
