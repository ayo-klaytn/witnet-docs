# Generating Randomness

There are two major approaches to generate unpredictable and malleable randomness from the Witnet oracle:

* Using the [**WitnetRandomness Contract**](randomness-contract.md), also known as the «_**Witnet Randomness Oracle**_», that can be used by practically all kind of dapps, and that it has been already pre-deployed by the Witnet Foundation on [multiple chains](../witnet-web-oracle/contracts-addresses.md).
* Posting a low-level [**WitnetRequestRandomness** ](randomness-requests.md)to the [WitnetRequestBoard ](../witnet-web-oracle/api-reference/api-solidity/solidity-contracts/witnet-request-board.md)entrypoint.
